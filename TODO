1. Clean up the outputting.
2. Output the conicident gammas and the gammas that have it as a coincidence.
3. Search by other things than the gamma energy.
4. Implement efficiency, log(ft), B(GT), intensity
5. Figure out some way to construct the decay scheme. 
6. Fix the range output to accept an inverted gamma range (B < A). 
7. Update help output.
