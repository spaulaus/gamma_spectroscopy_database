1. Implement a way to delete records from the database.
2. Clean up the outputting.
3. Output the conicident gammas and the gammas that have it as a coincidence.
4. Search by other things than the gamma energy.
5. Implement efficiency, log(ft), B(GT), intensity
6. Probably need some more info for the coincidence gammas, such as fitted 
     information. Maybe these should be moved to a separate text file?
7. Figure out some way to construct the decay scheme. 
8. Fix the range output to accept an inverted gamma range (B < A).
